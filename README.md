dotfiles
========

## My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, I gained much inspiration from 
[Michael Smalley](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)
. They are a work in progress, as I am only adding what I understand. There are many dotfile repos out
there, but for the most part are filled with adjustments that I never realize. So I am making my own
adding only the customizations I want and/or understand.

VIM is mamanged through pathogen, taken largely from 
[VIM Casts.org](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/). I will be 
modifying it a bit, since I am not sure how the git submodules will work.
